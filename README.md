* Forked and modified from https://github/srpeck/encryptedgist and https://ithub/b1nch0/encryptedgist
* using API via https and javascript with codemirror and sjcl
* currently 256 bit aes
* sublime shortkeys as default
* stores gist id and token in browser localstorate , see settings knobs
* Standalone JS and HTML5

## Be sure to use a github acces token ( yourrealusername:token instead of yourrealusername:password ), basic auth is still supported , but only with token ( PATCH  gives 404 with regular password etc. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34477537/github-gist-api-patch-doesnt-work )


improved version:

* uses 256 bit encryption now

* has emacs and sublime keybindings

* uses localstorage for token and gist id

* indicates that you "read -then-write" in the button

* has clear buttons for all stored things

Client-side encrypted plaintext editor that can persist/sync with GitHub Gists.

All text is synchronized in an [encrypted](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/) state.
https://github/srpeck/ had a similar use case to [SDEES](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12441302) ([Code on GitHub](https://github.com/schollz/sdees)), but needed a zero-install, browser-based solution.

The editor is customized to my personal usage - CodeMirror in Vim mode for pure plaintext notetaking across multiple fixed-configuration machines (VDI, etc.). Often this includes confidential notes that I do not want to share with Google/Microsoft/GitHub, hence SJCL client-side encryption. Depending on your usage, you may want to inline everything in a single HTML file and/or add localStorage for offline/single-machine use, similar to [Encrypted](https://github.com/srpeck/encrypted).

Currently file filename field is locked first, because the script only loads the main gist file.
You can save it under any name , but remember it will always open your "main" file.
